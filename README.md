# Global Financial Inclusion and Credit Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes financial inclusion and credit behavior across Asia, Africa, and Europe using Global Findex and CPI data. Our goal is to uncover insights that can guide policymakers and financial institutions in improving financial inclusion and developing targeted financial products.

## Key Features
- Regional analysis of credit card ownership
- Examination of borrowing trends and purposes
- Predictive modeling for credit access and default risk
- Assessment of financial inclusion barriers
- Exploration of CPI impact on financial behaviors

## Data Sources
- Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database by the World Bank
- Consumer Price Index (CPI) data [specify source]

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- [Add any other significant libraries or tools]

## For Technical Audiences
- Data preprocessing steps include [brief description]
- Machine learning models used: [list models]
- Evaluation metrics: [list metrics]

## For Non-Technical Audiences
This project aims to understand how people in different parts of the world use credit and financial services. We look at things like:
- Who owns credit cards in different countries
- How people borrow money and what they use it for
- What makes it hard for some people to get loans

Our goal is to help banks and governments make better decisions about financial services.
