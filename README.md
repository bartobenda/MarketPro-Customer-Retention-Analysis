## For Non-Technical Audiences
This project aims to understand how people in different parts of the world use credit and financial services. We look at things like:
- Who owns credit cards in different countries
- How people borrow money and what they use it for
- What makes it hard for some people to get loans

Our goal is to help banks and governments make better decisions about financial services.
